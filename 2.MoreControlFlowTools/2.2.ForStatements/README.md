# 2.2 for Statements

The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an **arithmetic progression of numbers** (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the **iteration step** and **halting condition** (as C), Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):
```python
# Measure some strings:
words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
for w in words:
  print(w, len(w))
```
```python
Output:
Cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12
```

Code that modifies a **collection** while **iterating** over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:
```python
# Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
for user, status in users.copy().items():
    if status == 'inactive':
        del users[user]

# Strategy:  Create a new collection
active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
    if status == 'active':
        active_users[user] = status
```
